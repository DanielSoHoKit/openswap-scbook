# üìå Introduction

## OpenSwap

OpenSwap is a next generation DEX, offering innovative swapping and liquidity solutions to enable DeFi users to efficiently and effectively swap and provide liquidity in the growing multi-chain landscape.

### Who is Involved

OpenSwap is introduced by a team of seasoned technology experts who are supported by IJS Technologies, with contracts reviewed by CertiK, Beosin, and Peckshield. OpenSwap is also part of the first cohort of Impossible Finance.

### **Summary**

As the DeFi universe continues to expand, onchain liquidity becomes increasingly scattered and less efficient across multiple chains and the situation is poised to get increasingly worse as new chains emerge with individual DEXs on each chain.

OpenSwap is envisioned as a next generation DEX that is composed of a basket of self-service DeFi technologies that can be freely mixed and matched like lego blocks and be structured for different needs and in different market conditions.

OpenSwap‚Äôs technologies can cater to all ends of the decentralized funnel, protecting swappers from what previously were thought of as ‚Äúmust-haves‚Äù onchain and crosschain problems, allowing users to have access to the best yield and incentives, and enabling projects to establish funding and sustained token health, giving project teams the freedom and bandwidth to focus on what they do best - BUIDL.
