# The Interchain Contract Structure

### Main Chain Contracts

One blockchain will be selected as the main chain which will designate the smart contracts deployed on the main chain to act as the master while all other side chains will serve as replicates. This means that the Bridge Troll registry will be enabled and Bridge Troll NFT staking will take place on the main chain. The main chain contracts will also include the functionalities deployed on the side chain. Upon initial release, Binance Smart Chain (BSC) was selected as the main chain and this may be transitioned to any EVM compatible chain as the bridge community deems fit in the future.

### Side Chain Contracts

The Side Chain Contracts are mainly responsible for end-users interactions on liquidity management and cross-chain token bridging. The Bridge Trolls will also interact with these contracts to release tokens. Upon initial release, the side chain contracts will be deployed Binance Smart Chain (also the Main Chain) and Avalanche C-Chain. Other EVM compatible chains may be added to the Open Interchain Protocol by deploying the Side Chain Contracts.
