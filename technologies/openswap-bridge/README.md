# Open Interchain Protocol
## OpenSwap Bridge
### *Welcome to the Open Interchain Protocol*

The Open Interchain Protocol is the infrastructure powering the OpenSwap bridge.

The protocol consists of a network of validators called Green Bridge Trolls and signers called Mean Bridge Trolls. These bridge trolls work together to reach a consensus to consummate a bridge transaction.

The goal of the Open Interchain Protocol is to provide a trustless bridge for native assets utilizing a “lock and release” mechanism between two blockchains

### **The OpenSwap Bridge Today**

We are currently in the pilot phase to facilitate bridging of $OSWAP between BNB Smart Chain and Avalanche C-Chain. The Open Interchain Protocol will launch with 3 Mean Bridge Trolls and 5 Green Bridge trolls. This phase consists of three events:

1. Bridge Vault Staking - Single asset $OSWAP bridge vaults launched on both chains for HODLers to stake (Live) 
2. Green Bridge Troll Staking - 5 Green Bridge Trolls launched and available Troll NFT HODLers to stake (Live)
3. Pilot Go-Live (Pending)

The current release provides the DApp for the community to stake into the bridge vaults, mint NFT Trolls, and stake NFT Trolls on Green Bridge Trolls to activate them.

Final preparations for the Mean Bridge Trolls are in progress by our trusted partners and the Pilot Go-Live is expected by the end of March 2023.

### **The OpenSwap Bridge Tomorrow**

The Open Interchain Protocol will work with any EVM-compatible chain and it is expected that the bridge will go wherever the $OSWAP goes next. Potential blockchains in consideration are Ethereum, Polygon, Moonbeam, Arbitrum, and Optimism with the ultimate decision being dictated by the community, bridge founders, and $OSWAP holders. 

With the ultimate goal of providing a trustless bridge, the OpenSwap team will continuously work towards providing a client package for you to run your own bridge troll to participate in the Open Interchain Protocol. As the network grows, the Open Interchain Protocol will evolve with it to include a governance model with $OSWAP to add token support for a particular chain.
