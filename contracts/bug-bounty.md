# Bug Bounty

In order to provide extra incentives for our community to review and protect the integrity of our smart contracts, OpenSwap has partnered up with Immunefi to provide this Bug Bounty. White and grey hat hackers among us can report vulnerabilities in the protocol in exchange for the rewards.

This program will offer up to $50,000 to anyone who can find viable and actionable vulnerabilities in OpenSwap’s code. The submission of a bug can be done by going to OpenSwap’s tab on Immunefi here, [https://immunefi.com/bounty/openswap/](https://immunefi.com/bounty/openswap/)

Examples of issues would be the ones related but not limited to:

* Thefts and freezing of digital assets or unclaimed digital assets
* Theft of governance funds
* Governance disruption

More details can be found in the page linked above.
