# Audit Report

Even though OpenSwap is still in beta, we want our contacts to be as solid as possible. This is why our contracts are audited by Certik, a leading blockchain security audit firm that combines manual testing, static analysis, and formal verification for the most robust smart contract security in the industry.

You can access the audit report here: [https://github.com/openswapdex/openswap-core/blob/master/audit/PeckShield-Audit-Report-OpenSwap-v1.0.pdf](https://github.com/openswapdex/openswap-core/blob/master/audit/PeckShield-Audit-Report-OpenSwap-v1.0.pdf)

The current coverage includes OpenSwap’s contract vulnerabilities for Liquidity Queues deployed on BSC. Exploits resulting in asset loss would qualify for a valid claim.

As OpenSwap expands onto other chains and releases more features, we would continue looking into insurance options so as to safeguard our users’ funds.
