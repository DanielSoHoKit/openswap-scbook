# Insurance

OpenSwap has partnered with Tidal Finance to cover our users fund. We have purchased $1 million USD worth of coverage through Tidal to cover our protocol’s safety. In the case of payout, the amount will be paid directly to the OpenSwap Team and after that, the team will distribute that amount to affected users.

The current coverage includes OpenSwap’s contract vulnerabilities for Liquidity Queues deployed on BSC. Exploits resulting in asset loss would qualify for a valid claim.

As OpenSwap expands onto other chains and releases more features, we would continue looking into insurance options so as to safeguard our users’ funds.
