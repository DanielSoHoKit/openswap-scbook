# Risks

As OpenSwap is in Beta, please use it at your own discretion. Remember to DYOR (do your own research). OpenSwap establishes trust with the community through 3rd party audited smart contracts and have protocol parameters transparently managed through a governance portal from launch. Learn more about OpenSwap before you connect to your Metamask. As always, donâ€™t put more than you can afford to lose.
