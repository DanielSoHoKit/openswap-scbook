OSWAP token was established as an ERC20 token, and was bridged to Binance Smart Chain (BSC) to enable the governance of the BSC version of OpenSwap during the initial launch. OSWAP tokens have no financial value.

OpenSwap has designed its tokenomics to support a sustainable long-term project ensuring that:

* 95% of all tokens will be subjected to locking and gradual vesting schedules
* Over 70% of all tokens will be subjected to vesting schedules of over 24 months
* Core team allocations and related tokens are subjected to long-term vesting periods to ensure community member confidence

#### OS Pro

Project Owners will need OSWAP tokens for access to OS Pro offerings upon feature release. Further information on exact OSWAP token utility for this category will be elaborated closer to feature release date.



OSWAP token is an ERC20 token with a 1B hard-capped total token supply. OSWAP tokens was bridged to BSC during the initial rollout, and will continuously be bridged to other chains as the OpenSwap project matures and develops.
