# OS Pro

#### How can a retail investor take part in it?

OS Pro is position as a project-focused subdivision of the greater OpenSwap ecosystem. However, this doesn’t mean that retail investors are barred from participating. Whenever a project wants to use a service that would involve the community, a portal would be set up on the OpenSwap DApp enabling access for retail investors to participate. For example, in the scenario that a project wants to start bonding with our OS Pro’s Bond Market, retail investors could choose to bond with their LP tokens.

#### How can a token project apply to be part of OS Pro?

Interested projects can directly reach out to the OS Pro team in the OpenSwap Official Community on Telegram.

#### How would this bring utility to OSWAP token?

The OS Pro team is actively exploring ways to give utility to OSWAP tokens with OS pro’s services. Some of the examples would be revenue sharing with the revenue generated from OS Pro’s services. Alternatively, the team is also considering ways to charge other projects for our services in the form of OSWAP tokens. More updates will be given as the rollout approaches.
