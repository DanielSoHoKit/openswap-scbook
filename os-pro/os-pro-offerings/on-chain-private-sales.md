# On-Chain Private Sales

An end-to-end on-chain solution for projects to facilitate sales rounds. The offering targets private or whitelisted buyers. Projects can then choose to set different parameters for these sales rounds such as price, vesting, potential secondary market and buybacks. Projects using this offering can raise funds without immediate sell pressure.

After the project decides to set up a round of On-Chain Private Sales, OS Pro would provide the values to enter to write a smart contract including a list of whitelisted addresses. Then, these whitelisted users can opt to deposit tokens to take part in these sales. If there is a buy-back guarantee, part of the deposit will go to our collateral escrow contract and rest, minus fees, will go to the project, otherwise, all of the proceeds, minus fees, would go to the project.
