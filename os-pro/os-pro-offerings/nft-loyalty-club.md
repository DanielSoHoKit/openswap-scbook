# NFT Loyalty Club

An innovative way for projects looking to increase community engagement. OS Pro will help the project setting up NFTs that can be redeemed after staking a certain amount of project tokens. These NFTs can be generated with Chainlink’s VRF to ensure the randomness. Projects can decide if these NFTs can provide additional perks and rewards to improve its desirability.

An example of these NFTs would be OpenSwap’s very own Bridge Trolls NFTs. The perks of these NFTs include an APR boost in staking, occasional airdrops etc. And the utility of these NFTs would be that the holders can serve as a validator in our upcoming Open Interchain Protocol.
