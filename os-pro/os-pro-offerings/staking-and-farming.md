# Staking & Farming

Traditional staking is available on OpenSwap for projects to lock up tokens to control supply while offering rewards to stakers. OS Pro can help projects set up these vaults with tokens and potentially help projects depositing them into AMM pools if it is an LP token so as to help build up the liquidity. This can be used in conjunction with the NFT Loyalty Club to provide additional rewards for the loyalest of supporters.

As with our other offerings, the parameters are very flexible. The projects can choose the reward rate, token types, where the token is deposited to, optional locking and vesting etc.
