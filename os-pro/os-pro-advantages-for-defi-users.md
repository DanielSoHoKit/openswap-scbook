# OS Pro Advantages for DeFi Users

#### More tokens at a lower price

The tokens sold by On-Chain Private Sales are usually a lower price and guaranteed by a buy-back queue. Whereas in the case of bonding, a discount would be offered by the protocol in order to attract investing. In both cases, investors could often get more project tokens under the market price.

#### No impermanent loss

Same as 1), if investors choose to take part in Pn-Chain Private Sales, impermanent loss either does not exist and is borne solely by the protocol.

#### Ensured liquidity

If a protocol chooses to use our Bond Market or Liquidity as a Service (LaaS), the liquidity depth would be deepened by that service. Users can trade for those tokens more freely.

#### Lower slippage

Same as 3), protocols that use the mentioned services could build up its liquidity. With higher liquidity, the slippage of each transaction is lowered.
